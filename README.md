# SplunkBaselineVsAttack
Creating Dashboards in Splunk

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, we were given two sets of logs: Windows Server logs, and Apache web logs.  In each set one log represented baseline activity while the other an active attack.
We were tasked with creating alerts from the baselines and dashboards illustrating baseline vs. attacks.
